# Array Menu
Array menu is a simple C/C++ program that contains number of operations which can be used on arrays. I created it to get better understanding of arrays and abstract data types. 

## Operations
#### 1. Display 
Shows the elements of array.
#### 2. Append
Adds new element at the end of array and extends it.
#### 3. Insert
Inserts new element to the given index and extends the array.
#### 4. Delete
Deletes the element at the given index and minimize the array.
#### 5. Swap
Swaps both elements indexes.
#### 6. Linear Search
Searchs for given element and returns its index but it uses linear algorithm.
#### 7. Binary Search
Searchs for given element and returns its index but it uses binarial algorithm.
#### 8. Recursive Binary Search
Same as binary search but uses recursive functions and algorithm.
#### 9. Get
Returns the element from the given index.
#### 10. Set
Changes the value of given index.
#### 11. Max
Returns the biggest value.
#### 12. Min
Returns the smallest value.
#### 13. Sum
Returns the sum of all elements of array.
#### 14. Avg
Returns the average (sum/number of elements) of array
#### 15. Reverse
Reverses the array.
#### 16. InsertSort
Inserts the given value between next smaller and bigger value. (Works in a sorted list)
#### 17. isSorted
Returns true or false depending on the if the list is sorted.
#### 18. Rearrange
Sorts the list.
#### 19. Merge
Merges both array into single one. (Requires two array)
#### 20. Merge - Union
Merges both array into single one but no duplicates.
#### 21. Merge - Intersection
Merges both array into single one but only same values.
#### 22. Merge - Difference
Merges both array into single one but only different values.
